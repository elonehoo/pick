# Why Pick?

> We would love to explain to you why we created Pick, what advantages it has, and our purpose

## Why Pick?

The truth is, Pick has a long way to go in terms of development. Components must be created, improved and fixed. For now, Pick should not be used for a real application. However, we are working very hard to achieve the stable version and have the strength to use it in any application.

- Pick is a framework designed to have a lot of visual impact and that is always in trend with respect to design.
- Many components for the use and creation of an entire application
- Adaptive design in all components
- An open source community to create, improve, and fix any component or function
- Independent components to prevent importing unnecessary code
- Semantic components
- Markdown documents for better maintainability
- And much more

## Support Pick

Pick is just beginning and we love the contribution of our small, but talented community. If you like Pick, we invite you to help and contribute. It can be as little as a grammatical change in the documentation, or the development of a new component or improvement. Either way, we are very grateful for the support of the whole community.

This framework is open source and every day the community is working on improvements, components, and documentation. If you have a new idea, a problem using Pick, or simply see an error in the documentation, we would love your support! Improve Pick by opening an issue or making a pull request so that each day Pick is a better framework for our front-end community.

## Comparison with Other Frameworks

- Great visual impact
- It's a new framework that has the latest libraries and frameworks (like Vitepress for the documentation and Vite to compile)
- Easy to update documentation to improve and create
- Rapid update flow, improvements and new functionalities
- Designed from scratch to be incrementally adoptable

## Our goal

We want to be the first framework of Vuejs components that help create thousands of applications. We also hope to grow a large community of developers that support one another in creating and improving products.
